;;; Commentary:

;;; Given the number of acronyms associated with emacs and gnu it is
;;; perhaps surprising that this idea for the dynamic expansion of
;;; acronyms is not already available in emacs. 

;;; This provides a method to type in acronyms and have them expanded
;;; in place. Its interface is similar to that of `dabbrev'. That is,
;;; an expansion of the acronym is looked for in the current buffer
;;; then other open buffers and if the expansion found is not what you
;;; want then calling `magpie-expand' again immediately rejects the
;;; present expansion and replaces it by a new one if such exists. It
;;; also includes ordinary dabbrev expansion. If there is no expansion
;;; of the acronym left it will try to expand prefixes of your acronym
;;; whilst retaining the unexpanded part of your acronym for later
;;; re-use.

;;; To be more precise, we type a string which takes the following
;;; form. The first character is often a control character which
;;; determines how the remaining characters should be transformed into
;;; a regexp. The next few characters are alphabetic and these are
;;; transformed by a recipe determined by the control character into a
;;; regexp of some sort. Finally, the last character or characters may
;;; be a number which is simply how many extra words should be glued
;;; on the end. Thus in this buffer ",pam4" could expand to "provides
;;; a method to type in acronyms" as would "prov6". The absence of a
;;; control character means that the expansion should be of `dabbrev'
;;; type and if the control character is "," then an acronym expansion
;;; should be used whilst if the control character is "." then an
;;; acronym expansion method is used but the text should begin inside
;;; a mathematics environment in a LaTeX document. For example,
;;; ".EEpAB" might expand to "\\Ext_{E^{\perp}}(A,B)". This
;;; illustrates other properties of the expansion method which is that
;;; the capitalization of the acronym determines the capitalization of
;;; the inserted string and also that the inserted string should
;;; consist of balanced sexps (balanced on the right but not
;;; necessarily on the left) if possible; in this particular case this
;;; would mean that ".EEpA" would also expand to the same phrase since
;;; the regexp match would include the first bracket "(" and the
;;; closure must then contain "(A,B)". There is a further wrinkle
;;; which is set up specifically for typing LaTeX. The string ",aat/i"
;;; will expand to "and assume that $$ is" with the cursor between the
;;; two dollar signs if this phrase (with something between the two
;;; dollar signs) occurs in the buffer. After typing here, "\C-."
;;; takes the cursor to the end of the inserted phrase. Finally, let
;;; us suppose that we type ",aattkifp" for which there is no
;;; expansion. Depending on the buffer contents, we may find that this
;;; is expanded to "and assume that ,tkifp" with the cursor at the
;;; space before the comma. If "and assume that" is not what we want
;;; then calling a`magpie-expand' will attempt to replace it; if it is
;;; what we want then `magpie-complete-expand' will attempt to expand
;;; the rest; for example we might get "and assume that the \kalg is
;;; finitely presented". I have provisionally bound `magpie-expand' to
;;; "\M-n" and `magpie-complete-expand' to "\M-N". However, for
;;; myself, I have bound them to "\H- " and "\A- ".

;;; one final wrinkle when typing LaTeX. If we call `magpie-expand' just
;;; after a $, it simply inserts the contents of the previous inline
;;; math environment that has length at least 6 and further calls to
;;; `magpie-expand' replace this by steadily more distant strings of the
;;; same type. If we call `magpie-expand' just after _{ it inserts a
;;; previous subscript of length at least 6 and if we call it after ^{
;;; we get the same for superscripts. Finally if we call it just after
;;; { not preceded by either _ or ^, it finds the contents of a
;;; previous pair {} provided that this is not a sub- or superscript.

;;; It is worth being precise about what an acronym
;;; matches. Specifically words are strings of alphabetic characters
;;; (for me this is [a-zA-Z]+ but this is customizable: see
;;; `magpie-alphabetic-chars') separated by non-alphabetic characters.

;;; I have also done similar things for editing Emacs Lisp files. Here
;;; again acronyms can be very useful. So I have set things up so that
;;; the control character "," introduces an acronym for strings from
;;; the buffer in a similar way to the above (using the same
;;; convention for words as in the previous paragraph). However, the
;;; control character "." introduces an acronym for symbols where
;;; words as above are separated by hyphens. Thus ".bdcu" expands to
;;; "backward-delete-char-untabify". This not only searches the
;;; current buffer but also looks at all symbols. This way of
;;; searching for names of symbols is substantially quicker than
;;; standard completion and I have also written functions below that
;;; incorporate this method (actually a related one) called
;;; `magpie-execute-extended-command', `magpie-describe-function' and
;;; `magpie-describe-variable' which begin by asking for a partial
;;; acronym for the command, function or variable you want (thus "bdc"
;;; matches "backward-delete-char" but it also matches
;;; "backward-delete-char-untabify") and then use a standard
;;; completion mechanism if there is more than one match. The reason
;;; for using prefix acronyms rather than full ones is that one may
;;; not remember the full name and this allows one to find it via the
;;; usual completion mechanism if one knows how the symbol's name
;;; begins.

;;; The system is highly extendable. As an illustration let us suppose
;;; that we wanted to include the ability to replace a regexp reg by
;;; some expansion from the buffer of the regexp. We choose a control
;;; character, let us say, ?;, and we add the association (cons ?;
;;; magpie-any-regexp) to `magpie-control-chars-alist'. The reader should
;;; then follow through the recipe for constructing `magpie-any-regexp'
;;; along the lines of `magpie-acr-template'. After this has been done
;;; then the string (concat ";" reg "4") would expand to a match for
;;; the regexp reg followed by the next 4 "words".

;;; The method is rather general because first we construct some
;;; regexp and find a match for it. Then we may adjust precisely which
;;; buffer-substring we use programmatically. We then apply a further
;;; function to compute what string we are goint to insert. Finally we
;;; have control over what we do when we insert the string (which is
;;; what allows us to set up a simple template mechanism).

;;; Things to do: Add further methods for constructing useful
;;; regexps. Think about ways to store past expansions though I am not
;;; convinced that this is wholly useful and it is not the way dabbrev
;;; operates.

  "Expand the string before point \"dynamically\".

If the string before point is alphabetic then the behaviour is
like that of `dabbrev-expand'. More generally, the
string-before-point will have the form of a control character (at
present , or .) followed by an alphabetic string and then a
number. The control character determines what kind of phrase is
looked for. If it is \",\" then the alphabetic string is expanded
as an acronym to some phrase in the buffer whilst if the control
character is a \".\" it is again expanded as an acronym for some
string occurring inside a math environment. The role of the
number is to determine how many words to glue on the end. Thus
the string \"alp4\" would expand to \"alphabetic then the
behaviour is\" as would the string \",att2\" if `magpie-expand'
were called in this buffer directly after each of these
strings. (See the first line of this paragraph for where this
expansion is taken from.) 

If the control character is \",\" then the alphabetic string may
also contain \"/\"s. In this case, we still expand as an acronym
but the slashes represent inline math environments. The expansion
will splice out the contents of the inline math environments and
will leave a template where these environments remain to be
filled in. For example, the string \",aat/i\" could expand to
\"and assume that $$ is\" where the cursor would be between the
two \"$\"s. After typing here, the key \\[pop-editing-position]
takes you to the next part of the template or to the end of the
expansion when all parts of the template have been dealt with.

If the character before point is \"$\" at the time `magpie-expand'
is called then the contents of the previous inline math
environment of length at least 6 is inserted at point. Similarly,
if point is just after \"_{\" or \"^{\" when `magpie-expand' is
called then the contents of the previous sub- or superscript
respectively (of length at least 6) is inserted at point.

If `magpie-expand' is called directly after it has been called then
the previous expansion is rejected and the next one if any is
inserted.
