;; Description :
;; 
;; mpcel.el is a mpc frontend for Emacs. mpc is a command line tool to
;; interface mpd (the Music Player Daemon). With mpcel.el you can control
;; mpd through mpc with the aim of playing your music collection.



;; Installation :
;;
;; 1) install mpc (http://www.musicpd.org/mpc.shtml) 
;;    & mpd (http://www.musicpd.org)
;; 2) type in your .emacs :
;;     (load "/path/to/mpcel.el")
;; 3) evaluate the previous expression, or restart Emacs.
;; 4) to start the mpd daemon type M-x mpcel-mpd-start
;; 5) to add songs type M-x mpcel-add-songs
;; 6) more help can be find on my website (EmacsWiki doesn't accept
;; it, mail me for more information)

;;                (defcustom ; call-process ; eq ...). He's the source of
;;                almost all the differences between v1.0 & v1.1
;; Richard M. Stallman & Erwin David : who pointed out to me
;;                that my old project description was rather laconic.
;; John Sullivan : who pointed out to me that the adress of the FSF
;;                has changed ;)
